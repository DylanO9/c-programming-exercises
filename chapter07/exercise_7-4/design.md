- What does scanf do?
    - Scanf is pretty much like printf, but we are storing the values from the format into the variables we pass
    - For example: int scanf(char \*format, ...) 
    - Reads the characters form standard input, and interprets them according to the specification in format, and stores the results through the remaining arguments
    - Input must match the control specification
- What features of scanf are we going to support?
    - d for decimal integer
    - s character string
    - f floating-point number  
- How is this going to work?
    - scanf skips blanks and tabs in its format string, skips over whitespace to find a token
    - We can skip blanks and tabs, and then grab the token
 - What if the token is together like "%d%s"?
