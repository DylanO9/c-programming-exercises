Here is a test file that can test our entab program
We want to see if a string of blanks can be replaced by the minimum number of tabs
and blanks to achieve the same spacing
Here is the test             boom
Here is with mixed tabs and spaces            there
   here is a good test too for small amounts of spaces and no tabs
